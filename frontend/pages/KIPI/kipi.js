          <p>
            To participate in KIPI as a presenter, you need to register and submit an abstract â€”a short summary of research paper on the topic you have chosen. All abstracts will be reviewed and presented at the KIPI 2022 Conference. However, if the prospective presenters could not join the live presentation or want to submit a poster, they are required to submit an academic poster.
